# AI Guidelines

## Project-Specific Guidelines

You are working on a React project with the following details:

- Language: TypeScript
- Framework: React.js
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Routing: No routing
- API Integration: Axios for API calls

## Project Rules

- Use React.js pages and components structure.
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling needs.
- Use Axios for all API requests.
- Follow the project's specific coding conventions and naming conventions.

## Code Formatting

- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use single quotes for strings unless double quotes are necessary.
- Use arrow functions for all functional components.
- Destructure props and use path aliases for TypeScript imports.
- Use consistent naming conventions for components and files (e.g., PascalCase for components).

## Performance

- Implement Next.js Image component for all images.
- Use React.memo and useCallback for optimizing component re-renders.
- Implement code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense.
- Optimize API calls with caching and debouncing.

## Security

- Sanitize all user inputs using a library like DOMPurify.
- Validate data types and escape content where necessary.
- Use secure authentication practices (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
- Follow OWASP guidelines for preventing XSS and CSRF attacks.
- Ensure all API calls are secure and follow best practices.
