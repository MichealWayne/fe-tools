- Use Vue3 Composition API for component logic.
- Use TypeScript for type safety.
- Use Less for styling within Vue components.
- Follow the project's specific coding conventions and naming conventions.

## Code Formatting

- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use single quotes for strings unless double quotes are necessary.
- Use arrow functions for all asynchronous operations.
- Destructure props and use path aliases for TypeScript imports.

## Performance

- Use code splitting and lazy loading for components.
- Optimize images and assets.
- Use environment variables for configuration.

## Security

- Sanitize all user inputs using a library like DOMPurify.
- Validate data types and escape content where necessary.
- Use secure authentication practices (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
