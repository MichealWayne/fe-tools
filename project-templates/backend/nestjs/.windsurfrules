# AI Guidelines

## Project-Specific Guidelines
You are working on a NestJS + TypeScript project with the following details:
- Framework: NestJS (platform: Express)
- Language: TypeScript
- Routing: Nest Controllers
- Middleware/Guards: Global filters, pipes, and interceptors as needed
- Logging: log4js

## Project Rules
- Use NestJS controllers for defining API routes.
- Prefer providers/services for business logic.
- Register global exception filter for unified JSON responses.
- Keep logging centralized via log4js wrapper.

## Code Formatting
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use single quotes for strings unless double quotes are necessary.
- Use arrow functions for async operations where appropriate.
- Keep consistent naming for modules/controllers/services.

## Performance
- Apply caching or interceptors when needed.
- Avoid blocking operations in request lifecycle.
- Use environment variables for configuration.

## Security
- Validate and sanitize inputs via pipes or class-validator (if added).
- Follow OWASP guidelines for preventing XSS/CSRF.
- Secure API endpoints and avoid leaking sensitive data in logs.
