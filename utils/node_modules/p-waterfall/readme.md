# p-waterfall

> Run promise-returning & async functions in series, each passing its result to the next

## Install

```
$ npm install p-waterfall
```

## Usage

```js
const pWaterfall = require('p-waterfall');

(async () => {
	const tasks = [
		initialValue => getEmoji(initialValue),
		previousValue => `I ‚ù§Ô∏è ${previousValue}`
	];

	console.log(await pWaterfall(tasks, 'unicorn'));
	//=> 'I ‚ù§Ô∏è ü¶Ñ'
})();
```

## API

### pWaterfall(tasks, initialValue?)

Returns a `Promise` that is fulfilled when all promises returned from calling the functions in `tasks` are fulfilled, or rejects if any of the promises reject. The fulfilled value is the value returned from the last task.

#### tasks

Type: `Iterable<Function>`

Functions are expected to return a value. If a `Promise` is returned, it's awaited before continuing with the next task.

#### initialValue

Type: `unknown`

Value to use as `previousValue` in the first task.
